steps to test a real automatic update
all this works without code signing

modified from:
https://gist.github.com/iffy/0ff845e8e3f59dbe7eaf2bf24443f104

environment:
build on host win10
upload files to zootella.com
install on vmware win10

clone and run:
$ git clone https://github.com/zootella/tortuga
$ cd tortuga
$ npm install
$ npm run start

build:
delete the dist folder
increment the version in package.json, and the index.html you'll upload to zootella.com
$ npm run build, runs electron-builder plain
upload to zootella.com: (1) Tortuga-1.0.6.exe, and (2) latest.yml, which has the hash of just 1.0.6
in vmware, restore 'firefox' snapshot, navigate browser to zootella.com/tortuga, download and run the setup exe
the electron window says "Current version: v1.0.6, Update not available."

publish and update:
increment the version in package.json, and the index.html you'll upload to zootella.com
$ npm run build, runs electron-builder plain
upload to zootella.com: (1) Tortuga-1.0.7.exe, and (2) latest.yml, which now has the hash of just 1.0.7
in vmware, run tortuga
it finds update, downloads, closes, installs, and runs the new version
