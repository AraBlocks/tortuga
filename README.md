Electron apps are all the same!
Why doesn't someone write a sample project that demonstrates a common shell container for one?
That would get your new app going from zero to ship-it in a snap. üòÅ
It would also neatly [separate concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).

The example would choose the [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) path instead of the many others.
It would always favor simplicity.
It would avoid Webpack to preserve *View, Source* awesomeness, and not need a local webserver.

That'd be cool.
OK, fine, I'll do it.
You could probably even turn it into a book. ü§î

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zootella/tortuga
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

## Roadmap

Basic stuff everybody needs:

- [ ] **setup:** installers for win/mac/linux, for individual local and non-admin users, know every path it deposits stuff, and uninstall
- [ ] **update:** update from your website, not a server you or someone else needs to run
- [ ] **tray:** app shortcuts, start menu, taskbar/dock, system tray/mac menu
- [ ] **minimize:** `_[]X`/mac traffic light
- [ ] **html:** windows show html, images, and fonts you brought yourself
- [ ] **startup:** run on startup, do this not as a service, run before login, get startup and shutdown events
- [ ] **protocol:** query and register custom:// and file extensions, test as admin and not
- [ ] **instance:** single instance per running location, new launch from start/file extension/browser protocol forwards to running instance
- [ ] **modes:** nonmodal, modal, and disappearing modal windows to let a menu stick out beyond the edges of the window
- [ ] **vue:** change parts of a page with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and coalesce progress updates with [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)

The realm of the advanced, weird and experimental:

- [ ] **icons:** high-res and pixel-hinted icons
- [ ] **tile:** full-bleed win10 start menu tile with custom background
- [ ] **portables:** portable editions
- [ ] **portable:** carry a single stick between win/mac/linux
- [ ] **portable asar:** multiple different native modules in a single asar
- [ ] **refresh:** update app on electron browser refresh
- [ ] **p2p:** notify, distribute, and trust updates without a centralized anything
- [ ] **tabs:** tabs like a web browser but made of html and css
- [ ] **repl:** neo-repl ideas, a command-line style prompt in a page that can show form elements, and runs a command app in the same process with close and refresh
- [ ] **markup:** really simple markup becomes page ui

Intentionally avoiding:

- big, complex and/or complicated, hyper-automatic and megacool build and deploy pipelines
- local webserver
- webpack
- live update
