JSON doesn't allow comments, so you're making notes about package.json here



"dir": "electron-builder --dir",
"build": "electron-builder",
"publish": "electron-builder --publish always",
"ia32": "electron-builder --win --x64 --ia32"

dir just makes the portable-like directory, the first step towards installers
build is the default and apparently the only thing you need. makes directory, exe, and zip
publish is from n the update example, but seems to not be necessary
ia32 makes a setup.exe that's twice as big in case it gets run on 32 bit windows





(put back for signing)

this is for automatic updates

      ],
      "certificateFile": "../your_code_signing_certificate.pfx",
      "certificatePassword": "your_exported_certificate_password"

for windows signing
put your pfx file one folder up from this one so you don't accidentially check it into git
and paste your pfx file's password here


lots more to test out here:

    "nsis": {
      "perMachine": true,
      "differentialPackage": false

no differential package, please
this way, nsis won't make a blockmap
downloads may be bigger, but both build and install are simpler and faster
and the way asar works blockmaps aren't well optimized, anyways

    "step2": "electron-builder",
    "step3": "electron-builder --publish always",
    "step4": "electron-builder --win --x64 --ia32"

dir just builds all the files to a directory

step2 makes setup.exe 39mb
step4 makes setup.exe 76mb
testing automatic update with step2
